This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores the Black-Scholes model for option pricing. The notebook includes:

- Mathematical derivation of the Black-Scholes model
- Explanation of the lognormal distribution underlying asset prices
- Step-by-step solutions to theoretical questions
- Python code using NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, and NumPy.random for simulations and visualization

The project is ideal for those interested in financial mathematics and quantitative finance.
